# flight-controller-tester
Every time there's a new flight controller, we have to test the INAV target for it. Test each of the UARTs, PWM/servo  outputs, Dshot output pins, the LED pin, buzzer, camera, VTX. I got tired of soldering everything up just to take it all off again. So I made this FC tester. Touch the probe to each pin and it will report if it's working correctly.
